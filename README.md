# GAN
Here I have created a deep convolutional adversarial neural network for creation of anime characters and the architecture is loosely based on the research paper titled UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf
I have used a dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset
